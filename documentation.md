# Documentation

## Setting up `docker`
Follow the [official docker engine docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Do not install the `docker.io` package, install the docker engine packages listed in the official documentation. As a post-installation step, you can use 
```shell
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
$ newgrp docker
```
to avoid having to `sudo docker` all the time. 

## Setting up `nvidia-container-toolkit`
At the time of writing this, `nvidia-container-toolkit` is installed with `nvidia-docker2`. The [official guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#installation-guide) is good enough to get you started. In case you are running `Pop!OS`, make sure to [prioritize nvidia's apt repo over system76's](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/1388#issuecomment-1097326214).
