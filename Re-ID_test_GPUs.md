# TRACKING + RE-IDENTIFICATION TESTS LOG

This page serves as a log for the test conducted on the YoloV8 detection + Tracking + Re-Identification algorithm.

[Here](scripts/tracking_re-id_test.py) is the script used to perform the tests.

The whole pipeline is based on [BoxMOT](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/yolo_tracking). 

### Installation
While on a classic Ubuntu system the installation should be straightforward, to run the script on NVIDIA platforms you have to:
 - [optional] Create a virtual environment with Python3.8
 - Clone the BoxMOT repository following the instructions from the link above and install the package. Note: the installation process is highly verbose; to reduce the amount of text, omit the ```-v``` command when installing with pip.
 At this point, some issues might pop up:
- ```AttributeError: module ; setuptools.errors' has no attribute 'CompileError'``` -> Solution: ```pip install setuptools==59.5.0```
- ```error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'``` -> Solution: ```pip install wheel```
- Issue with grpcio -> Solution: ```pip install grpcio``` (takes some time to compile)

Run the installation command from BoxMOT again; everything should work fine.

Now, the torch and torchvision packages installed during the process do not work with NVIDIA platforms. To do so, you have to:
 - Uninstall them with ```pip uninstall torch torchvision```
 - Install torchvision following the steps [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/72048) at the "Installation" section (*)
 - Install torch following the steps [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/install-pytorch-jetson-platform/index.html#overview__section_xavier_nx)
Note: versions depend on the JetPack version of the device. In our case should be Torch 2.0.0+nv23.05 and Torchvision 0.15.1

(*) if you are in a virtual environment, to install torchvision inside it add to the PYTHONPATH the path to your Python executable (like ~/path/to/venv/lib/python3.8) and run ```python3 setup.py install``` WITHOUT ```--user```.

Finally, uninstall any precedent version you have of ultralytics. This package works only with its specific version. To get it, once all the installations work fine, run the ```track.py``` example in the examples folder to automatically download it.
