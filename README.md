# knowledge-base

This repo is an attempt at gathering and organizing a knowledge base shared between R&D folks. Every time something useful pops up, or you unearth a bit of arcane knowledge, or you feel like you _really should put a link to this somewhere_ so that future you can find it easily, make an entry here.

Make sure to assign every item to a major category and link it somewhere. Also, please write a short description to give some context to the link you are posting. In the future, in case this works, we might decide to turn this into a proper wiki!
